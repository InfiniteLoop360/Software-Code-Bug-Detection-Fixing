📝 **Your Code Review Report**

🔍 **I see that you've written this in JavaScript!**

❌ **Oops! There's an issue in your code.**
🔸 **Problem at Line 1:**
`function sum(){ return a + b; }` → **Variables `a` and `b` are not defined within the function scope. This will likely
cause an error when the function is called.**

✅ **Here’s the corrected version:**
```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 **Why?**
The function `sum` now takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are then added together and returned. This ensures that
the function has access to the variables it needs to perform the addition.
